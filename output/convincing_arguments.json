But aside from that, it can become an addiction that destroys lives just like drugs and alcohol. There is a reason why God tells us what to and what not to do.", "If God doesn't exist, how come there are loads of predictions, sent by God, written thousands of years before Jesus saying exactly what happened to Jesus?", "books is well better than tv because it is cheaper to buy a book  if you wanted to buy a tv it would be really dear and you have to buy a tv licence  books can help you learn  a lot of the stuff on tv is either violent or not right for kids  so books are well better", "Gays are human beings just like we are.

He established free trade and thus many people came to Singapore to trade with each other, boosting Singapore's economy.  Raffles was responsible for Singapore's boost of economy", "It would be better to have a lousy father than to not a have a father at all. If you were to grow up with out a father you would always have that empty void feeling about it. And if your father is lousy it helps you strive to be better than him. It could also cause you to start being responsible faster because the father isn't taking care of business. Like me and my brother, my father is lousy but I'm still happy i know who he is.

There's very little that beats the world described in books.", "If my husband had committed a murder I think I would not turn him in because my feelings would be stronger that the fear of having a bad husband, I am not sure of my exact answer but I am sure that I couldn't look at him everyday and act like nothing happened, I believe that feeling are stronger than anything and I would not like the fact that he would probably be sentenced to death or spend the rest of his life in prison.", "No I would not turn them in, because it would be to weird for me to turn them in to the police. I would probably wouldn't tell anybody. I would hope that the police catch them but I would not say anything. I would tell them to turn their self in.", "No, i don't think they should be spanked because in my opinion i don't think it works, maybe it will once, but as they grow up it's not a good technique to do, because then y'all wont have a good relationship and the relationship will not grow. There is other techniques they can learn from.", "There is an argument of people saying is gay marriage acceptable or unacceptable. I would say most of the population of Britain would say it is wrong however I think anybody should be allowed to express there feelings to the one they love so I think it is acceptable. Because how come we can get married to the other secuality however a man can't express his feelings to a man or a woman and a woman as gay sexuality I think gays should be allowed to do what they like when they like !!", "its simple, how would we be able to adapt to different enviroments. Over time we adapted to what suited us best otherwise why arn't we one skin colour, why are there so many types of animals", "Gay people are making a terrible mistake.

If it was like that for normal marriage life would be a whole lot better.", "Raffles neglected Singapore when he went around conquering other 'more useful' countries for about FOUR years, leaving all the work to Farquhar to settle. Plus, to drive my point further, the countries that were run by Raffles all ended up BADLY. This shows that Raffles was a bad developer of the country.", "hells yeah porn is wrong. i mean wtf. film naked girls to publicly distribute it on the internet so jerk off's can jack off to them. porn is only here because it makes so much money and stupid people are buying into it. if it's not wrong then try watching it in front of your family, friends or the younger youth. yeah you would feel uncomfortable and you know why? because of common f**king sense and our conscience deep inside we know it's wrong.", "Farquhar contributed significantly, even forking out his own money to start up the colony carved out of the jungle, by first offering money as an incentive for people to hunt and to exterminate rats and centipedes. Raffles did nothing of that sort.", "Spanking should not be an option to discipline a child, parents have a lot other options before spanking. Its better to talk to them about what they did wrong and solve the problem in a proper way.", "(I am writing this through Firefox) Emotions aside, Firefox has no ActiveX support.

I Bet 90% Of The IE Supporters have only know that single browser.", "Honestly, I'd rather be completely fatherless, not saying that not having is better than having one, albeit a lousy one. However, I do believe that you can grow up completely fatherless and without any major male role model and still be successful. Take myself for example; I lived the first thirteen years of my life without a father or any fatherly interaction, and those were the essential times a kid needed to be around his/her father, I turned out great(Self-opinion).

When Singapore was once infested with rats and centipedes, Farquhar rewarded the people with coins for every pest they catch. This solved the problem quickly, as he held to his promise.", "Having a lousy father does not just leaves bumps, scrapes and scars externally. The damage goes much deeper. During those vital years of childhood having a bad dad isn't something that one forgets easily. Not only does it alter self confidence and self worth, it can covertly brand those bad habits in the mind of the child. The characteristics of an unfit parent are poisonous. I believe that it is better to be fatherless, rather than have a lousy father. Yes, it will take much effort to fill the shoes of the missing party, but it can and should be done.", "This is planet Earth, shared by billions, not just you. If given the opportunity to advance the human race, every person alive should take it; choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There's no other way around it.

They might be sick in the head but she would be my wife.

Maybe if he gets arrested,he can feel guilty for what he has done and try not to repeat it again. And also how can i trust a murderer?He can even be telling a lie to me and maybe can kill me for someone else in the future.so Just by confiding to me does not make him clean and innocent."]}}
